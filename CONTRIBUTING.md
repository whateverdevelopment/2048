# Contributing

Changes and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request. Please make your changes in a specific branch and request to pull into `main`! If you can, please make sure the game fully works before sending the PR, as that will help speed up the process.

## How to make changes

+ To make changes, create a new branch based on `main` and make them there, then create a Pull Request to main.
+ Please use 2-space indentation when editing files.
+ Please test your modification before submitting your Pull Request.

## Changes that might not be accepted

We have to be conservative with the core game. This means that some modifications won't be merged, or will have to be evaluated carefully before being merged:

+ Undo/redo features
+ Save/reload features
+ Changes to how the tiles look or their contents
+ Changes to the layout
+ Changes to the grid size

## Changes that are welcome

+ Bug fixes
+ Compatibility improvements
+ "Under the hood" enhancements
+ Small changes that don't have an impact on the core gameplay
